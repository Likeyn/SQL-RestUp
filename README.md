### SQL RestUp

SQL RestUp is a RESTful interface written in PHP designed to expose a SQL database.
This tool is basically a copy of the existing [PhpRestSQL project](http://phprestsql.sourceforge.net/ "PhpRestSQL on SourceForge") but with some more features.
I used it and tweaked it a bit for a student project in 2011 - 2012, and haven't touched it since then.
