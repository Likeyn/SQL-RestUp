SQL RestUp
==========

SQL RestUp is a RESTful interface designed to expose a SQL database written in PHP.
This tool is basically a copy of the existing PHPRESTSQL SourceForge project -- http://phprestsql.sourceforge.net/ but with some more features. I used it and tweaked it a bit for a student project in 2012, and is currently provided as-is.
